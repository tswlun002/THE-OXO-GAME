# THE OXO GAME 

This game i developed in my first year course.

Project is to develop a version of the OXO GAME in which two players are given two different shapes, shape X or shape O and if a player get three same shape in a row, vertically, horizontally or diagonally will win. Game must give the user message after every move and game must be able to give score after game ended. This project will allow players to apply and develop their mathematical thinking during the game which is vital for our life style. The OXO game software will be written on python 3 with the PYQT5 GUI layout.
